# Mu-naco

An experimental version of [Mu](https://codewith.mu) made with Microsoft's
[Monaco code editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/). Packaged vi
a [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/).

The application is in the `mu` directory. Embedded Python for each supported
platform is in a directory indicating the platform, in the `python` directory.

Tests (unit and integration) are in `tests` and documentation (using Sphinx) is
in `docs`.

Most of the common processes for developing Mu can be found in the `Makefile`.
Type `make` to see what you can do.
