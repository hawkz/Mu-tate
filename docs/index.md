## What?

Mu is a very simple Python editor for kids, teachers and beginner programmers.
It's written in Python and works on Windows, OSX, Linux and the web.

> "[Papert] realized, 'Oh, we could take the real content out here as a
> version in the child's world that is still the real thing.' It's not a fake
> version of math. It's kind of like little league, or even T-ball. In sports

> you never let the child do something that isn't the real thing -- but you
> have to work your ass off to figure out what the real thing is in the
> context of the way their minds are working at that developmental level."

Mu aspires to be "the real thing" as a development environment for beginner
programmers taking their first steps with Python.

As a rule of thumb, if you're able to ask "why doesn't Mu have [feature X]?"
then you're probably too advanced for using Mu as a development environment. In
which case, you should graduate to a more advanced editor.

## Why?

There isn't a cross platform Python code editor that is:

* Easy to use;
* Available on all major platforms;
* Well documented (even for beginners);
* Simply coded;
* Currently maintained; and,
* Thoroughly tested.

Mu addresses these needs.

## How?

Mu's outlook is:

* Less is more (remove all unnecessary distractions);
* Keep it simple (so Mu is easy to understand);
* Walk the path of least resistance (Mu should be easy to use);
* Have fun (learning should be a positive experience).

## Who?

**You!**

Contributions are welcome without prejudice from *anyone* irrespective of
age, gender, religion, race or sexuality. If you're thinking, "but they don't
mean me", *then we especially mean YOU*. Good quality code and engagement
with respect, humour and intelligence wins every time.

Read about [contributing](contributing.md) and perhaps try out some
[first-steps](first-steps.md).

We want the Mu community to be a friendly place. Therefore, we expect
contributors to abide by the spirit of our
[Code of Conduct](code_of_conduct.md).
